# 🛡️ Intrusion Detection Workshop – DDoS Attack Detection

This project focuses on detecting **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks** using supervised machine learning techniques.  
It was developed as part of a security and intrusion detection workshop, leveraging real-world network traffic data to train and evaluate classification models.

---

## 📌 Overview
DDoS attacks are a major threat to modern network infrastructure, overwhelming services with massive volumes of traffic.  
The goal of this project is to build an **automated detection pipeline** that can distinguish between malicious and benign network flows with high accuracy.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** CSE-CIC-IDS 2018 / CIC-DDoS2019 dataset
- **Content:** Network flow statistics extracted from packet captures (PCAP files)
- **Features:** Includes packet size, flow duration, byte counts, window sizes, etc.
- **Target:** Binary classification — `BENIGN` vs `ATTACK`

## ⚙️ Features & Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical features
   - Feature scaling
2. **Model Training**
   - Implemented models:  
     - Logistic Regression  
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
     - Random Forest  
   - Train/test split with stratification
3. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion matrix for performance visualization
